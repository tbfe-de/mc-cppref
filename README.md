Minor improvements to `Presentation/pages.html` now
completed (though there probably are more things not
yet uncovered).

Collection of examples added in `Examples`.

Many additions made to `explorarions.cpp` â€“ but the
exploration proposals still need to be added to the
presenter's notes sections. (Currently this is only
the case for the first few pages, though in many
cases the exloration is obvious as it more or less
is to turn an example cocde fragment into code that
can be compiled and tried out.)

---------------------------------------------------
As of 2018-02-27 17:30 with some explorations added.

Stil some open issues, like minor nodifications and
additions to the presentation and more explorations.
