Re-generated printable files used as hand-out to
course participants:

* `PDF/pages.pdf` and
* `PDF/Infographics.pdf`

---------------------------------------------------
Known improvements to `Presentation/pages.html` now
completed. (Of course there may be more issues, not
yet discovered). 

Collection of examples added in `Examples`.

Many enhancements to `explorations.cpp` â€“ but the
exploration proposals still need to be added to the
presenter's notes sections. Currently proposals in
text form only for the first few sections, though
the later exploration are typically obvious as they
usually centered around a code fragment presented
which needs to be completed so that it finally can
be compiled and tried out.

---------------------------------------------------
As of 2018-02-27 17:30 with some explorations added.

Still some open issues, like minor notifications and
additions to the presentation and more explorations.
